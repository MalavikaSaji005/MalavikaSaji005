🧩 About Me

I'm a CSE student from Kerala who believes tech is more than just code —
it's about emotion, people, and ideas that stick.

From drawing posters to designing UI, from childhood dreams to real-world projects —
I love giving life to things that matter.

🛠️ I started with no tech background.
Now I'm building apps, pitching ideas, and exploring the space where logic meets creativity.

✨ I believe:

Actions > words

Design should speak

Every “no” is a push to show up louder next time
