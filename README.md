#Hi, I’m Malavika! 👋

🎨 Creative techie | 💡 Problem solver with heart | 🧠 Gen AI & Design Explorer
🚀 Building tech with purpose — one wild idea at a time



##🧩 About Me

I'm a CSE student from Kerala who believes tech is more than just code —
it's about emotion, people, and ideas that stick.

From drawing posters to designing UI, from childhood dreams to real-world projects —
I love giving life to things that matter.

🛠️ I started with no tech background.
Now I'm building apps, pitching ideas, and exploring the space where logic meets creativity.

✨ I believe:

• Actions > words

• Design should speak

• Every “no” is a push to show up louder next time
